There are situations where we expect a movie getting a high rating, but the results turn to be opposite.
Question that arises is that – what are the factors that are influencing movies to get a higher rating!!
Movie has lot of dimensions that influences its rating, so we analyzed the IMDb historical movie data and found some factors that are influencing the ratings

So, 

1. When you want to watch a movie, what would be the driving factors to do that!! – movie ratings would be one of the main factors
2. If the movie has a higher rating then there would be higher probability, a person watching that movie
3. IMDb movie ratings are most popular among the other movie rating websites such as movielens, yahoo ratings etc.,
